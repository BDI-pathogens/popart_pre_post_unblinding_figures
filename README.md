Selected supplementary figures for the manuscript entitled: *Prevention outcomes from univeral testing and treatment in a generalised HIV epidemic (HPTN 071 [PopART] trial): a modelling study*.  


All rounds from the same data source are shown in a single figure/file.  For instance, if CHiPs rounds 1-3 were used in fitting of a particular community, they are shown together (e.g. `fig_S22.1.AWARE.CHIPS.pdf` shows rounds 1-3).  Different years of DHS and HSRC data are shown as rounds but they correspond to the years of these surveys used for fitting (e.g. DHS "rounds" 1-3 are from years 2002, 2007, 2013 respectively, and HSRC "rounds" 1-4 are from years 2002, 2005, 2008, 2012 respectively).
