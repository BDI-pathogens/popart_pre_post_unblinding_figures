# popart_pre_post_unblinding_figures

Selected supplementary figures for the manuscript entitled: *Prevention outcomes from univeral testing and treatment in a generalised HIV epidemic (HPTN 071 [PopART] trial): a modelling study*.  


### Parameters


This repository has two types of parameter sets: 

* `parameters/calibrated_parameters.tar.gz`: calibrated parameters for all 21 communities used in the computational experiments
* `parameters/calibration_unblinding_params_IAS.tar.gz`: fixed parameters for all 21 communities (prior to calibration, and a subset of the previous file)

### Figures

Additional figures from the research article listed above are housed in this repository as they are too numerous to have in a single PDF.  


**Figures S26: Model fit**


Figures S26.1-S26.21 present the model fit to observed data, stratified by age and sex, for all 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa and are provided as a compressed folder in the below repository.  Figures S26 are labelled according to the scheme S26.C.M.T for community C (1-21), metric M (HIV, AWARE, ART, VS), and time T (PC0, PC12, etc).  The metrics stand for HIV prevalence (HIV), proportion aware of HIV status (AWARE), proportion on ART (ART), and proportion virally suppressed (VS).  For instance, figure S26.3.HIV.PC12 shows HIV prevalence in community 3 over PC12 time period.  


**Figures S27: Parameter posteriors**


Figures S27.1-S27.17 present the marginal posterior distributions of the 17 parameters used in the calibration process for all 21 communities for Zambia and South Africa in the post-unblinding fit of the model.  Several estimated parameter posteriors were highly peaked (figures S27.1-S27.17).
