# popart_pre_post_unblinding_figures

Selected supplementary figures for the manuscript entitled: *Modelled outcomes for generalised epidemics based on findings of the HPTN 071 (PopART) trial: projections from before and after unblinding of the trial*.  


All rounds from the same data source are shown in a single figure/file.  For instance, if CHiPs rounds 1-3 were used in fitting of a particular community, they are shown together (e.g. `fig_S22.1.AWARE.CHIPS.pdf` shows rounds 1-3).  Different years of DHS and HSRC data are shown as rounds but they correspond to the years of these surveys used for fitting (e.g. DHS "rounds" 1-3 are from years 2002, 2007, 2013 respectively, and HSRC "rounds" 1-4 are from years 2002, 2005, 2008, 2012 respectively).
